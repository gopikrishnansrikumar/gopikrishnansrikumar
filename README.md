# Hello there

I’m **Gopikrishnan Srikumar**, a **Senior Engineer and LLM Agentic Systems Researcher** focused on developing intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative AI systems.  
My work bridges **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent coordination**, and **adaptive control frameworks** to build scalable agentic intelligence.

- Currently developing **[AgentBridge](https://github.com/gopikrishnansrikumar/agentbridge-framework)** — an open framework for building and orchestrating LLM-based agentic systems  
- Working with **MCP**, **A2A**, **LangGraph**, and **Google AFDK** to design next-generation **agentic infrastructures**  
- Exploring architectures for **autonomous reasoning**, **tool-augmented LLMs**, and **multi-agent collaboration**  
- Open to collaborations on **LLM-based research**, **agentic system design**, and **AI automation pipelines**  
- Experienced in **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning**, and **Applied AI Engineering**
